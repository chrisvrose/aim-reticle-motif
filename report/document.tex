% 1. for each campaign that you run provide details including
% - Did the target program build? If not, why did it not build?
% - What was the duration of the campaign?
% - What coverage did the campaign achieve?
% - How many crashes did you find?
% - What could you learn about the causes of the crashes?
% 2. Comment on differences in campaign outcomes across your campaigns.

% Marks out of 10 are allocated as follows:
% 1. build target without sanitizers (1 mark)
% 2. campaign profile (2 marks)
% 3. build target with at least two sanitizers (1)
% 4. campaign profiles (2 marks: 1 mark each per sanitizer)
% 5. crash investigations (minimal: 2 marks, impressive: 4 marks)

% ## Misc

% - Did you find any crashes?
% - Did you find more crashes with the sanitizers? Are they different crashes?
% - What are the causes of the crashes? (The sanitizer should give some vague info; and keen students may be able to find the associated CVEs)
